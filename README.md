useful autokey phrases

I am trying to get into the habit of storing tools/utilities/macros that I use often on github so I can check them out as I move from
workstation to workstation.  I will store my autokey phrases here.  So far there are some short phrases for common bootstrap phrases.
They save me some typing. Maybe they will save you some too.
